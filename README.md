# OpenRazer libusb Fork
## Why?
- I am annoyed of the official software because of its cpu and ram usage
- I am annoyed of the official software because they want me to log in
- The original only supports linux
- I am too stupid to build the original for my arm devices

## So?
This highly stripped version allows a platform indipendent possibility to program your keyboards leds.
Maybe a super simple gui or an config file will be added. For now, the effects can only be set programmatically.
